# Monk's Quest
Monk's Quest is a parody on King's Quest from 1984 but is more spritually oriented.


## Notes:
- Instead of three physical treasures, it will be three acts of enlightenment.
- The King from the original game will be replaced by the Abbot of the monastery.
- A simplified leveling system will be added to the game based upon score, responses to situations and the three acts of humility aforementioned.

### Personal Notes:
- I personally refuse to have anything to do with Windows anymore. Windows is an evil environment in which programming in C, C++ and pretty much any other low level language is a near impossibility. Just to create a window in Windows is a total nightmare. Therefore, all of my code for this game will be aimed strictly for Linux.
- As much as I loathe Windows, I know that there is going to be a group of people out there that think the way I use to and will still want to include Windows support. So, here is a branch for those free thinkers. :)
- I don't know anything about Mac nor do I currently own one, as much as I would love to. Therefore, I can only make the branch for Mac coders and then let them have their fun with this game as well.
