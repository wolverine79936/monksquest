# Monk's Quest
Monk's Quest is a parody on King's Quest from 1984 but is more spritually oriented.


## Notes:
- Instead of three physical treasures, it will be three acts of enlightenment.
- The King from the original game will be replaced by the Abbot of the monastery.
- A simplified leveling system will be added to the game based upon score, responses to situations and the three acts of humility aforementioned.
